EMAIL FROM FELEGE
So for the APIs you can use twilio for the texting service and as for the
e-mails, I wasn't given a specific API but TAs reccomended using IMAP for where
you basically just send the email from a gmail account or something after
logging in. But I'd be aware that gmail has started treating imap-based methods
as "insecure" and will try to warn users away from using services that
authenticate via IMAP/SMTP. For purposes of a 32 project it should be fine to
ask whoever's account is used to demo to be set to allow "insecure"
authentication methods for email clients.
